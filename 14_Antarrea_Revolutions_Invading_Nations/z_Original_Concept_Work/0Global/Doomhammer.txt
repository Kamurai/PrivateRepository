Doomhammer:

Arek has been commanded not to take the Doomhammer.

If it touches Arek, it is psychically activated and Arek gains command over himself.


There should be a scene where the Doomhammer is stolen and Arek is actually struck by it, doubled over and takes control of the Doomhammer.


He start his "one Shade army" and has to be stopped....


by whom is undetermined.
