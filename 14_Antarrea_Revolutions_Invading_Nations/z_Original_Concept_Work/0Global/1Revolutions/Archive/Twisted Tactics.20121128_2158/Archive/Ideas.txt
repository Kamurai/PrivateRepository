Any character can equip any equipment, despite class, but will benefit more from having certain jobs.

Armor:

Option 1:  Armor just adds Hp to character's max hp (Final Fantasy Tactics)
Option 2:  Armor deflects attacks (increases "evasion") (Dungeons and Dragons)
Option 3:  Armor reduces damage to character (Attack - Defense = Damage) (Most standard)
Option 4:  Armor has hp, and permanently absorbs that much damage before overflowing to character (Attack - Defense = Damage)
	Option 5:  For permenant absorption, Armor has a % chance to break (% increases when hp is exceeded)
	Option 6:  For permenant absorption, Armor breaks when hp is exceeded

Option 7:  Armor absorbs a small amount, permanently, before allowing overflow to character, and character has "normal" hp
Option 8:  Armor absorbs all of the damage, before breaking, and if armor is broken, then character takes the damage with its relatively small hp
