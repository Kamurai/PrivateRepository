Antarrea:
Invading Nations:
Tactics Adventure: Option A


Format:  Similiar to FF: Tactics, party travels from one location to the next entering battles 
at random or at set stoyline positions.  Upon entering a battle the party designates a number 
of members to form a battle squad.  Moving into an already progressing battle, the squad may 
ambush other squads.  Any squad has the option to flee at anytime.  Upon entering the world 
map, all characters are fully rejuvenated.
	
	Character statistics will remain extremely similiar to other Anatarrean systems, 
differing chiefly upon classes.  Abilities are gained by earning enough points to "buy" the abilities;
 the same points also determine which level the characters's class is & whether or not the 
character may upgrade to the next class yet.

Story Option:
The world will concentrate first on the Human, & then expanded to (most probably) the 
Elven continent, then across the Grendol all the way to the Dragonlands and back to Avia Promised, & finally
 to the lands of the Daemon and the Dark.

Nations Unite storyline is promising, but begins in the Human nation.

Start storyline for Invading Nations with Invasion plans converstaion seque to human resistance group led by Sir, planning to
 overthrow the current government being controlled by the vampire nation.
