Lady Death

	Its like...having good sex...for the first time.  That rush of touching someone,
that new exciting adrenaline rush of a fresh experience.  Imagine if you could relive that 
moment at your beck and call, if true fulfillment and ectasy at any given moment, what would you 
give for that?  What would you sacrifice for such a revolution?  Who would you sacrifce 
for such...a...miracle...yes, I can truly say that this act is truly a miracle!

	You would sacrifice anyone for this kind of power, no everyone.  The enamored rage 
caused by the burning desire to feed your whims, to be overwhelemed by it.  It is such an 
enlightened, orgasmic feeling that you hope it'll never leave you, but it will, so quickly that 
you're not even sure if you remember how it felt, just that it was so good, and you'd surely kill again for its thrill.
Each person you meet sends chills up your spine; you just thinnk how good each person will pay off.  I 
use to think the same way about money with people, each person being a walking amount of money.
That was always business, this is purely pleasure, and okay I...always get the bonus "loot the corpse" fun time, 
if I come the hell around before someone notices or at least the Enforcers get there.  With 
all the incidents, each one with its own overly powerful orgasm (no, I wasn't exaggerrating), 
I can't help but wonder what underwear will be the easiest to clean, toss or should I not wear any 
and just take teh time to clean up, no don't want to leave that kind of evidence, what will 
the media say then?

	I don't mind being a whore, and being a serial killer is worth it, but I don't really need 
it on world wide news.  They're already giving me a bad rap and making it harder to get at people; 
its a little hard to go to it in public (no that just wasn't right, was it?)  After all they have 
everyone this side of the planet looking for LADY DEATH.
