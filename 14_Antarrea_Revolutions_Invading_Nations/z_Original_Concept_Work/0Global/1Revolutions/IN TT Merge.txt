The Twisted Tactics class/job system will be used for Antarrea or likewise Twisted Tactics will be placed in Antarrea.


Tactics class system and job charts are present in Twisted Tactics, possible to alternate some jobs and / or give certain 
a character a bonus to its attributes based on class and race.
Item bonuses apply as normal, with additional race and / or class bonuses.





Special Characters:
Two options:

	Option 1: Treat character as a monster with fixed  abilities (ugh).

	Option 2: Start special character with a high level job and stats, possible bonus class for character.

	Option 3: Possibility of using an item that specifically allows bonuses for a specific class.

Twisted Tactics structure will not allow for a specified job class and / or nonexistent abilities for a general job class.

Given a special character, a high level job class, and / or / plus a job class bonus for that job 
via an item clashes the least of all options.  (Option 3)

Unique names and bonus items, weapons, armor, and accessories are easier to give bonuses to as they are individual times 
and actual objects.







Cross classing system for secondary abilities:  
A point system or maximum of secondary talents needs to be established past what abilities the job allows
 as primary abilities,
i.e. Psy-engineers get both psionics and tecnology as primary abilities.
 
	Solution:  Fixed secondary ability is a single space item ability, and primary abilities define the character.
