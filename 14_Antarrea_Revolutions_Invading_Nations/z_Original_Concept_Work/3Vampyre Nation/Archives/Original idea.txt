A warrior fighting for her life, stumbles onto one of the world's darkest secrets....a vampyre who will only be known as 
Origin.  He saw her losing battle and made her the offer of immortality for his own sustenance.  So after she was kill that 
night, the next night a funeral procession was held in her honor, but the body was not found...she, had turned.  Learning 
about herself and what she has become, she only wishes she had not survived the "incident".  Cursing her decision, she makes 
one that may have equally been bad...to take on the world of Vampyres.  With no rest (for the wicked ;) she began engineering
state of the art, anti-vampyre weaponry during the day within the confines of her laboratory, and applying her findings by 
night.  She has the one advantage other Vampyre Hunters do not....she's one of them, and plays with the same rules.  Superior 
strength, agility, speed, balance, senses, and psyonic activity, her only downfalls: ultraviolet radiation, and the THIRST.  
Put away your crosses, holy water, and garlic, ye need not be afraid, unless....you're one of 'em.
