Determine First player:
	Decide amongst yourself through any method of yelling, rolling dice, pulling straws (not hair), etc.

Player turn:
	Each turn a player must move a character on the board.
	Tokens move in one of two ways:
		One space in any direction. (Like a King in chess)
		Able to jump multiple pieces. (Like a King in checkers)
	That character must end closer to the alter than they began.
	If a player CAN sacrifice a character, they must.
	
Scoring:
	A player get +1 points equal to the value of the character sacrificed.
	A player gets -1 point on a turn they did not sacrifice a character.
	
End condition:
	No characters are left on the board.

Victory condition:
	The player with the lower points wins!
