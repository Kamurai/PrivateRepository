GRENDOL: LAND OF THE ORCISH EMPIRE: AGE OF MAGIC


	ONCE THE CIVILIZATIONS WERE SPARSE & UNAWARE OF ONE ANOTHER, BUT EVENTUALLY, AS ALL THINGS HAPPEN, THE RACES LEARNED 
OF ONE ANOTHER & DOMINANCE MOVED FROM INSIDE THE TRIBES TO ONE ANOTHER.  AND NOW THAT THE TRIBES HAVE LEARNED OF OTHER RACES,
 THEY BEGAN TO SEARCH FOR OTHERS TO DOMINATE.  WE KNOW THAT IN THE END THE ORCS GREW THEIR EMPIRE, BUT THERE'S A STORY 
BEFOREHAND.


TROLL LANDS(WHITE)		-PROTECTION, REGEN, PACIFY, RANGE
OGRE TERRITORIES(GREEN)	-FORCE, RESILENCE, BOOST, SEARCH & DRAW
GOBLIN KINGDOM(RED)		-RANGE, TRAPS, DIRECT DAMAGE, RESPONSES, DESTROY
ORC EMPIRE(BLACK)		-RESILENCE, REGEN, MELEE, DRAIN BOOST, DESTROY

FIVE RACES FROM THE AGE OF MAGIC.  GRENDOL WAS NEVER AT SUCH A FURY AS IT WAS BEFORE MAGIC HAD BEEN NULLIFIED & THE 
HOBGOBLINS SLAIN FOR THEIR MISTAKE.

EACH PLAYER DRAWS 5 CARDS TO BEGIN THEIR HAND, & PLACES ONE CREATURE IN THE LIFE ZONE, & ONE LAND OF THE SAME TYPE IN THE 
MANA ZONE.  A CREATURE IN THE LIFE ZONE IS THE LIFE TO DEPLETE FOR THE MATCH.  EVERY TIME THE CREATURE TAKES DAMAGE, IT IS
 PERMANENT, AND WHEN THE CREATURE DIES, THE ONLY NEEDS TO ATTACK THE BLANK LIFE ZONE ONCE.  THE ONLY WAY TO REPLACE A LIFE
 ZONE CREATURE IS FOR IT TO DIE AND ANOTHER CREATURE PLAYED IN THE EMPTY ZONE FOR 2 X CASTING COST.  YOU CANNOT RECALL A 
LIFEZONE CREATURE.

BATTLE:  				CREATURES ATTACK ONE AT A TIME, ATTACK VERSUS DEFENSE IN AN ORDER CHOSEN BY THE PLAYER.

ORDER:

(DRAW PHASE)			DRAWING INITIATES A PLAYER'S TURN.

(FIRST CHANCE PHASE)	PLAYING A MANA CARD INITIATES THE FIRST CHANCE CASTING PHASE.

(BATTLE PHASE)			A CREATURE ATTACKING INITIATES THE BATTLE PHASE.  EACH CREATURE ATTACKS SEPERATELY & RESOLVES DAMAGE 
						INDIVIDUALLY.  THE BATTLE PHASE ENDS AFTER THE DAMAGE RESOLUTION OF THE LAST BATTLE (THE LIFE ZONE 
						CREATURE IS THE LAST CREATURE THAT ATTACKS, REGARDLESS IF ALL CREATURES ATTACKED OR NOT).

(LAST CHANCE)			INITIATED BY DECLARING "LAST CHANCE" OR "TURNOVER", OPPONENT MAY ALSO DECLARE "LAST CHANCE" & CARDS 
						ARE PLAYED UNTIL BOTH PLAYERS ALLOW A TURNOVER & THEN OPPONENT BEGINS TURN.
