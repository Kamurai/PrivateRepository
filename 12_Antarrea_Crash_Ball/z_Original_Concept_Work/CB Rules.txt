ANTARREAN CRASH BALL

BATTLE APPLICATION:
	MOVING A MODEL ON THE BOARD IS BASED ON THE CREATURE'S SPEED, X # OF SQUARES EQUAL TO THE CREATURE'S SPEED.  WHENEVER
 A MODEL MOVES ADJACENT TO AN ENMEMY MODEL, THAT ENEMY HAS THE OPTION TO ATTACK IF THE MOVING MODEL DOES NOT ATTACK THEM.  
MODELS THAT MOVE & ATTACK GAIN "MOMENTUM".  "MOMENTUM" GIVES NEGATIVE MODIFER TO AGILITY & SKILL, BUT ADDS TO STRENGTH.  A 
SUCCESSFUL "MOMENTUM" HIT WILL KNOCK A MODEL BACK REGARDLESS OF SIZE.  WHEN A MODEL ATTACKS, THE VICTIM CAN CHOOSE TO COUNTER, 
STANDFAST, OR EVADE.  AN EVASION USES AGILITY, LUCK, & SKILLS, STANDFAST:  STRENGTH, SIZE, LUCK & COUNTER:  SIZE, STRENGTH,
 SKILL, & LUCK.

EFFECTS OF AN ATTACK:  KNOCK BACK, KNOCK DOWN, STUN, SLAM, INJURE, & KILL.

KNOCK BACK	-MOVE THE MODEL BACK ONE SQUARE.

KNOCK DOWN	-MOVE THE MODEL TO THE "DOWN" POSITION.

STUN		-MOVE THE MODEL TO THE "DOWN" AND THEN "STUNNED"

SLAM		-MOVE THE MODEL TO THE "DOWN", THEN "STUNNED", & THEN "SLAMMED"

INJURE		-THE MODEL IS INCAPACITATED, INACTIVE, OR REMOVED FROM BOARD FOR THE REST OF THE HALF

KILL		-THE MODEL IS INACTIVE FOR THE REST OF THE GAME

ORDER GOES:  "SLAMMED", "STUNNED", "DOWN", "UP"

SPENDING SPEED POINTS:

"MOMENTUM" TAKES UP SPEED AS DOES GETTING UP OR RECOVERING FROM "STUN" OR "SLAM".
IT TAKES 6 SPEED OR MAX SPEED TO RECOVER FROM "SLAMMED" TO "STUNNED"
3 SPEED OR MAX TO RECOVER FROM "STUNNED" TO "DOWN"
AND 3 SPEED OR MAX TO GET "UP".


MOMENTUM ATTACKS:  SUCCESSFUL ATTACKS THAT HAVE "MOMENTUM" ALWAY "KNOCK BACK" THE OPPONENT IF SUCCESSFUL & A "KNOCK BACK" RESULT 
COUNTS AS A "KNOCK DOWN".  IF A "MOMENTUM" HIT IS UNSUCCESSFUL THE VICTIM EVADES TO THE CHOSEN SQUARE & THE ATTACKER "TRIPS"
 INTO THE NEXT SQUARE ONLINE.  IF THAT SQUARE IS OCCUPIED, TREAT IT AS A NORMAL ATTACK ON THE NEW VICTIM, OTHERWISE ROLL TO 
SEE IF THE MODEL FALLS DOWN & HURTS ITSELF.

ATTACK:  (SKILL+STRENGTH)/2=X

MOMENTUM ATTACK:  ((SKILL+STRENGTH)/2)+1=X

DEFENDING ROLLS
