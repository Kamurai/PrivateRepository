Format:  Similiar to Tactics Ogre, the game will use a deployment system from the world map.  
Selecting a location opens the battle arena from which squads can be deployed for battle.  The 
Army may join an existing battle as an ambush or flee from a battle by recalling units.  Upon 
returning to the world map all characters are automatically rejuvenated.
	The world consists of all of Renley's only continent.
	The attacks of a character depends on its race & postion in the squad, as well as class
& weapon assignment.  Classes will eventually upgrade to become more advantageous.  Classes 
available for change will depend upon equipment, statistics, & experiences.
