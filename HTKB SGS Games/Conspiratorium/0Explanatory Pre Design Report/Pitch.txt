Conspiratorium:
You are a handler for "The Organization", each turn you must do research, turn an asset, direct an asset to a new location, or even call an assasination.  If only you knew who was who.

It is worth noting that all the pieces are black, their affiliation noted on the bottom of the piece, last man standing's affiliation wins.
