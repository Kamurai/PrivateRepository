	Twisted Tactics was originally designed to fulfill my desire to see if it was actually 
possible to design a game with 200 different classes.  I believe I'm still only around 175, but 
just the same, that's still an impressive number to me.
        All things considered in Twisted Tactics you and your party of adventurers travel through 
the world battling foes ands monster you encounter during your quest.
