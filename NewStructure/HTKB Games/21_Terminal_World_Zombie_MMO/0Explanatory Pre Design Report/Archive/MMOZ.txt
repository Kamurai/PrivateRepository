Massive Multiplayer Online Zombie Game:
	The "game" is more of a MMO simulation game where a viral zombie outbreak occurs.	
		

Perspective:
	Ideal perspective would be a 3rd person perspective adventure.

Experience:
	Ideally this would NOT be an RPG.
	A skill exp system should exist versus a standard experience system.

Ballistics:
	"Breathing" should be taken into account in shooting, or at least variable accuracy.
	(if applicable) Shooting skill should reduce variable accuracy's variance.

"Melee":
	(if applicable) Melee skill should only increase strength (thus increases potential damage).


"Spread":
	The origin of the disease can be started in the following variables:
		The time delay before the virus begins to spread.
		Random number of people. (1-x)
		Random location of originating person. (Random region: out of selected regions)
		Clustering: number of random originating persons per region. (selected by region)


"Sound":
	Actions and items can have a "loudness" factor associated with them which is equivalent to how many (relatively)
	pixels away the sound will travel.
		Either a "sound action" will call all zombies to measure their distance to the sound or
		(More likely) a "sound action" will generate a "sound wave object" that will alert nearby zombies.
		A "sound action" could call each zombie in it's range and set each zombie's attention to its coordinates.
