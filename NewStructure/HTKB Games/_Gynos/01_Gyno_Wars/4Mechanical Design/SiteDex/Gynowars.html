	I have long time be a fan of the RPG, and consider Squaresoft to the best gaming company in the world.
  I also believe Final Fantasy Tactics to the best RPG ever.  I also really like the TSR Dungeons and Dragons 
type of RPG with status sheets and a group of friends have fun with their games.  I believe the most extorted 
and misdirected if not misunderstood RPG is Pokemon, which is simply a game to makes lots and lots of money 
with some very good gamer designers caught in the middle of it.  The tedious quest to collect all the pokemon and 
level them up properly was great, though it does get old after awhile, and the graphics aren't enough to keep you 
entertained on their own.  The fact that you have to buy two game boys, trade amongst other people's, or buy two different games 
in order to capture all 151 pokemon is just plan STUPID.  And they did it again with Pokemon Silver and Gold, that is after of course 
Red, black, Green, and Yellow.  I don't see the point in repeating the game, but the people obviously bought them up, giving the company 
even more money to rip people off with.  Pokemon is often shunned by Anime fans as being to childish 
and a disgrace to all Anime because of all the memorabilia and exploitation. 
<br><br>
	I have aspired to....uh.....fix (?) the idea of Pokemon.  Instead of being insecure and designing the game 
to rip people off, I've decided to make the game an enjoyable experience for all people, and imploy some great ideas.  
Originally I'm designing this in a first person format, a game for people to play amongst themselves with a Host (DM).
Later on it will be changed to a game with a Tactics board, such as in Final Fantasy Tactics, but it is yet undecided as if that 
is going to be before or after I've turned it into a computer game.  My ULTIMATE GOAL is to make Gynowars the ultimate RPG, including a 
Tactics board and 168 different Gynos (which is what the characters/monsters are called).  I'm also hoping to make it an internet game one day.

The objective and view point of the game.<br>
<font size="3">
	You are a person in this world whose make up is completely different from that off Earth.  This world doesn't have a name yet, but that's okay.  
In this world you travel through the eight "sectors" of the world competing in official battle for access to the other sectors, arenas, and castle you haven't been to yet.  
You fight other Gynos with your Gynos in the wild, in official arenas and even in the streets.  Your objective can vary between being able to breed Gynos, create the ultimate Gyno army, or 
scientifically study each of the different types of Gynos.  This game is all about options, and personal wants, but in the end you still fight to save the world from the threat of invasion of 
the world from an army of Gynos planning to overthrow the Imperical Government.

The Names as it applies to reality.<br>
<font size="3">
	Gynowars have nothing to do with a gynocologist or however it is spelled...It means the war of the Gynos, the little sadistic monster of the world.  
There are 168 Gynos devised into 8 categories, 12 creature types, and 5 evolutions.  Each of these Gynos can be identified by their name, due to which endings their name has.
Though names aren't REALLY important, I'm really thinking about making the "nickname" option, but it is yet to be decided, as is the name of the world you play in.

The Elemental Basis of the game.<br>
<font size="3">
	Most RPGs have an Elemental basis, where creatures of a certain element are healed by that element, and are super weak against another.  Most games 
(including Pokemon) have moved past this system, and I intend to do so as well.  Though the game is wholey centered on elements (the 8 sectors of the world), I WILL NOT
 CHEESE IT!  Anyways the 8 elements are Battle, Plant, Shadow, Electric/Light, Air, Stone/Earth, Water, and Fire.  These are them, so NO GRIPING, cheers!
<br><br>
<font size="5">
Format of the Game.<br>
<font size="3">
	In the 1st person player (non-computer version), you will start in one of the 8 sectors of the world, and have a starter Gyno.  
you will go about this sector battling in the wild, at the local arenas, and eventually the sector castle.  Once you beat the sector castle, 
then you may continue to the next sector, having a slightly larger variety of Gynos to battle.  The battles will be done in sequenced turns in 
order of the Gynos' speed.  Each person in battle should be able to have about 3 Gynos in a battle.  I will try to develop a battle board for 
the game, most likely from a chessboard.  If I ever make a computer version, then it will incorporate walking on a world map, fights on a tactics board, 
battles in the wild, arenas, planned spots, and at random.  The tactics board will probably not include more than 3, but I want to have it so that you actually used up 
most of your Gynos during the time of a battle.  I'm also going to try to make each Gyno have an ability to do things independently.
