There is a game played amongst the Elves.  In the study of their magic to conquer the elements many entetaining side effects are observed.

One of these observations was made by a particularly young and delirious magic student.  He realized elementals are made of units of magical energy.

As his current lesson was "standardize" units of magical energy, applications: elementals, this itself was not remarkable.

It was the application of how many different combinations of the same magical energy could result.  To simplify, 4 may be 1,3 , 2,2 , 3,1 , 4,0 , or 0,4.

Actually creating and "stress-testing" elementals of these premutations against one another, the student observed which combinations were necessary to overwhelm the others.

He did this up three elementals a side, and able to manage three groups of this, he attracted enough attention to force it into some sort of organized frovality.

When more powerful magic users began to get involved, so limitations were placed on how many "standard" magical units could be used for creation.

This officially created a regulated game that carried onto all parts of the nation:
	Elvia Primia uses a standard card system.
	Elvia Elementalia uses their elementals like their ancestors.
	Elvia Necrolgia use various undead, which required a change of the "standardized" units.
	Gnoll Country even uses a modification of Primia's card system, but eliminates the use of magic altogether.
