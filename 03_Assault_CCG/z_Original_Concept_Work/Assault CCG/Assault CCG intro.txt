Assault formations:  A two rank formation is used when assaulting or counter assaulting.

	Assaulting:  	The second rank is protected by the first, and cannot be counter assaulted unless all the first rank creatures have been counter assaulted.
			A non-flyer cannot protect a flyer.
			A phased unit cannot protect a non-phased unit.

	Counter Assaulting:  	The defending player's formation counter assaults as is.
				The first rank must be assigned to counter assault before the second rank may be selected.
				
				There is no barring as to which creatures may be counter assaulted as long as the attacking player's first rank is covered one to one before assigning counter assaults to the assaulting second rank.
				option:  attacking first rank must be killed before second rank can be counter assaulted.
