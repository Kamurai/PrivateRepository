OPERATION: STRIKE FORCE (OPPOSTION) X(PANTHEON)


	HUMANS HAVE PROGRESSED IN GREAT BOUNDS, TECHNOLOGICALLY, & HAVE STARTED TO COLONIZE OTHER PLANETS IN THE 
SOL SYSTEM.  TERRAFORMING & COLONZATION WAS BEGUN ON THE MOON BY ENVIRONMENTALISTS & EXPERTS OF EVERY FIELD.  
GOVERNMENT FINANCED EVERYTHING FOR THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SCIENTISTS, INCLUDING LABOR.  SUCH A 
PURE PLACE COULD HARDLY BE ALLOWED TO TAINTED BY LOWER-CLASS & NON-GOVERNMENT, EVEN THE MARRIED SCIENTISTS WERE 
DISCOURAGED CHOICES.  SO THE ALREADY STRONG DRIVE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WAS PUSHED & SEVERAL 
APPLICATIONS CAME ABOUT.
	THE AMOUNT OF VARIANCE DEVELOPED AT ONCE SUGGESTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS ATTEMPTING 
TO HIDE ITS TECHNOLOGY TO AVOID CONFLICT. (CLONING).  MONITORS (ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COMPUTERS)
 WERE CREATED TO RUN SHIPS, COMPLEX, & SEVERAL VARIED OPERATIONS IN ABSENCE OF HUMANS & TO ASSIST 
THOSE PRESENT.  TO SOLVE LABOR & SECURITY ANDROIDS WERE ACTUALLY BUILT.  MANY OF THE LABOR ANDROIDS
 WERE VERY LIMITED A.I. WHILE SOME OF THE ASSISTANTS & SERVICE ANDROIDS WERE GIVEN A.I. COMPLEX 
ENOUGH FOR BRIEF CONVERSATION EVEN.  THE SECURITY/WAR(BATTLE) ANDROIDS WERE GIVEN EXTREMELY 
COMPLEX INTELLIGENCE & PROGRAMMING WITH SEVERAL VERY ADAQUATE ROUTINES FOR PROTECTING PEOPLE 
FROM THE B.A., & TO KEEP THE B.A. HIGHLY DEDICATED TO ITS PRIMARY FUNCTIONS.
	LUNAR BECAME ALMOST A FACTORY PREPARING FOR THE COLONIZATION OF MARS.  B.A. 1S WERE KEPT
FOR LUANAR TO PROTECT THE AGP (HAVOC), BUT THE CLONE SOLDIERS TRAINED ON LUNAR & B.A. 2S WITH 
EXTENDED PROGRAMMING FOR BROAD POSSIBILITY COMPENSATION FOR OPEN MISSIONS.  ONLY 100 HUMANS, & 
THOUSANDS OF HAVOCS, B.A. 2S & MONITORS WERE SENT TO MARS TO PERPARE IT FOR COLONIZATION.
	WHILE EARTH SEEMS TO REMAIN HIDDEN, THE COLONIZATION OF MARS DID NOT GO UNNOTICED.


	THE SOL SYSTEM HAD ALWAYS REMAINED HIGHLY INACTIVE TO THE PANTHEON, THAT IS UNTIL A SMALL 
FLEET OF LUNARIAN SHIPS LANDED ONTO MAR'S SURFACE.  NEEDLESS TO SAY THE OBSERVERS FINDING A FLEET
OF UNIDENTIFIED & ALIEN VESSELS, APPARENTLY FILLED WITH SEVERAL SMALL ARMIES, WERE EXTREMELY & 
POSSIBLY PANICKED INTO SENDING A TACTICAL FORCE & WONDERING IF IT HAD BEEN A MISTAKE.
	THE PANTHEON IS AN ALLIANCE OF DIFFERENT SYSTEM EMPIRES WHICH ARE WELL INTEGRATED & 
COMPRISE A RATHER EFFECTIVE NAVAL ARMY.  WHILE THE 3 MAJOR BATTLE RACES FIGHT IN THE SAME ARMY, 
EACH RACE IS CULTURALLY DIFFERENT IN BATTLE & THE PANTHEON BATTLE TACTICS APPEAR MORE LIKE 3 
ARMIES WORKING IN A TEMPORARY ALLIANCE RATHER THAN WELL ESTABLISHED & LONG LIVED BATTLE PROCEDURE.
	PALADINS, THE HONORABLE, HOLD THE ONLY COMMAND OVER MULTIPLE RACES, BUT DO TO THEIR 
PREFERRED HONOR CHARGES, BELIEVING IN FATE TO CHOSE THEM TO SURVIVE THE BATLE, OFTEN ON THEIR OWN.
	SPIDERS, THE DECEITFUL, ARE MUCH MORE CUNNING & ARE MORE LIKELY TO FLANK THE PALADIN CHARGES
THAN TO JOIN THEM.  SPIDERS HAVE A HIGH RATE OF SELF PRESERVATION & WILL LAY IN WAIT DURING A 
BATTLE FOR THE CRUCIAL MOMENT TO STRIKE.
	LOGANS, THE INDEPENDENT, ARE MUCH MORE UNPREDICTABLE EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT THEY ALMOST 
ALWAYS WORK INDEPENDENTLY.  WHILE NOT ABOUT THE HIDING LIKE THE SPIDERS, LOGANS USE STEALTH & 
SURVIVAL TACTICS TO A MUCH HIGHER DEGREE THAN THE PALADINS.
	THE DIFFERENCES IN THE RACES MAKE THEM A STRONG TACTICAL FORCE, BUT A FRAGMENTED & DAMAGED
GOVERNMENT.  THREE DIFFERENT ORGANIZATION WITH DIFFERENT LEADERSHIP, ALL WANTING SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
DONE WITH THE NEW MARTIANS.
	THE TRI-SECTS OF THE PANTHEON ARE SPLIT & BROKEN OVER THE MARTIANS, BUT CAN AGREE THAT 
STRIKE FORCES SHOULD BE SENT IN & THE REST CAN BE DISCUSSED EN ROUTE & AFTERWARDS.
