House That Kamurai Built Productions
A Comic Project - Psychodom Universe

	Sir sits as Empor on the throne of the Psychodom, the organization adjoining the people of Terra as a collective 
state.  Natural cases of psionic and magical powers have becaome evident, if rare.  As a social management of well-being 
project, several... activator serems were put into effect, none with any oustanding result at the time of testing or 
observation.  While the series of projects did increase physical well-being, the failure project was officially closed.  It 
was not until years later that Super Powered Beings began appearing and even then, it was sparse enough to be disbelieved.  
Most rumors being of young female civilians.  Only one man knew what project Ascencion would yield, and that man fears no 
result of his own actions.
