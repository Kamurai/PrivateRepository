Target

	Best decision I ever made, going in for that check up.  The medical examiner
was completely weirded out too.  Then the specialists too!  It was great, one shocked 
face after another.  They just defferred me to the same agency though, and they offerred
me the deal.  Oh man, what a deal that too.  That's all on the hush though.  The most 
surprising thing was that it hadn't occurred to me what would have happened had 
I refused until after.  And then the guy wouldn't even give me a straight answer.
Guess I should probably start at the beginning though, here we go...
