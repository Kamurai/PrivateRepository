Ded Sezter's Gynowars Battle Sequencing</p>
<font size="3">
1)  First off, battles are intiated at random in the wild, some towns, and are planned in the arenas, castles, and 
important plot scenes, or just when the Host (the DM) feels like it.
<br><br>
2)  At the start of the battle, the number of Gynos should have been established.  I suggest that anyone 
use up to 3 Gynos in a battle, but a player may not be forced into a handicapped match that he or she 
does not want to.  No player must accept a battle with another player, but if he/she does and forfeits, then the challenger wins
and gets experience.
<br><br>
3)  At the start of each turn, all Gynos roll their Spd.  The Gyno with the highest speed goes first, then the 
next highest, till the lowest, which goes last.
<br><br>
4)  A Gyno has the following options: attempt to Escape, use a Technique, use a Sune, or receive an Item.
<br>
  A)  If the Gyno is attempting to Escape, then any opposing player has the option to Pursue.  The opposing player chooses 
which Gynos will Pursue, and the Escaping and Pursuing Gynos roll their Act.  If the Escaper rolls higher than 
the Pursuer, then the Escaper is removed from battle.  If the Escaper rolls lower than the Pursuer, then 
the Escaper suffers an attack (do not roll to hit) from the Pursuer.
<br>
  B)  If the Gyno is attempting to receive an Item, then you simply remove the item from the inventory, and 
affect the Gyno by what the Item does.
<br>
  C)  If the Gyno is attempting to use a Technique, first roll the Attacker's Ac and the Defender's Ev, and add the 
respective modifers for the situation.  If the Attacker scores higher than the Defender it hits, if lower it misses, 
and if the rolls tie, then both Gynos skip their current turn (they are in Lock-Up).  Next roll the Attacker's AT and 
the Defender's Df and add the respective modifers for the situation.  If the Attacker scores higher or equal to 
the Defender's score, then subtract the Defender's score from the Attacker's and the remaining number is the damage 
dealt to the Defender.  If the Attacker's score is lower than or equal to the Defender's score, then the damage dealt to 
the damage dealt to the Defender is ZERO (none of that healing from a Black spell CRAP!).
<br>
  D)  If the Gyno is attempting to use a Sune, roll the Attacker's Se and the Defender's Sr (even for your Gynos).  If you are targeting 
one of your own Gynos, then you must half the Sr of the Defender.  If the Attacker's score is higher than the Defender's, then the Sune is effective.  
If lower, then the Sune is not effective.  If the two scores are the same, then the Sune is reflected upon the caster.
<br><br>
5)If any Gyno's attempt's fail or resolve, their part of the turn is OVER.  Continue until all but one 
player's Gynos have been reduced to 0 Hp.  When this has occur (The following is in attempt of being AMMENDED) resolve 
the experienced gain by the winners.  First add up the experience of all the defeated (not those that Escaped) 
Gynos, then divide that by the amount of winning Gynos.  For each of the winning Gynos divide that number by their 
Level, and you have the amount of Experience each winning Gyno should gain.  Then resolve any gains in 
Levels, or Evolutions, and the points requiered in doing so.
<br><br>
6)  Upon Leveling up a Gyno receives 2 points to distribute among its Resistance points, 4 Tactical points, +D10 Hp, +D5 Tp, and +D4 Sp.
<br>Upon Evolving, a Gyno changes shape and name and receives 4 points to distribute among its Resistance poins, 8 Tactical points, +D20 Hp, +D10 Tp, and +D8 Sp.
<br><br>
In the event that you do not have a probability machine/randomizer (as most don't) then simply use a D10 instead and add the statistics to that, it works for at least low level battles.
