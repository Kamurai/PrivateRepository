"First Day on the Job"
	There have been reports of issues at a distant mining colony in the far reaches of space.
	The sheriff there has made some odd reports, to include some spectacular criminal activity.
	There haven't been any recent reports, but the given reports are enough to move up a visit from the Federation.
	You fly transport into the system, land on the planet, and take the train into the town of "Mining Colony Zed".
