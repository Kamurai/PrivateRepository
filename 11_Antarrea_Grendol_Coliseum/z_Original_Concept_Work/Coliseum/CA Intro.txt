Battle:  Creatures are assigned to attack one at a time.  After each assigned attack, the opponent is allowed to counter 
assault each attacking creature, & you are allowed to counter assault the counter assaulting creature until all creatures 
have been assigned in battle (in one "chain" or another) or reserved (creatures just entering the coliseum must be held in 
reserve (like Summoning Sickness).  This can best be done by placing attacking creatures from one side to the other & place 
spaces inbetween chains.


20071124 Editation:

Objectives:  All damage done to creatures is permanent.  The objective is to clear out the opponents creatures so that you 
may have your creatures attack / reach the objective points in the coliseum unhindered.  The opposing player may choose 
to allow his objective point to be activated for strategic purposse, e.g. opposing player has two creatures that can score 
twice against the first, or simply does not want the last creature(s) to perish.

If one player is directly attacking a certain creature, that creature has an oppurtunity to run, but then may not be utilized 
to score.  One creature may not run from two different creautures, and may not run in two sequential turns.

A creature that is gaining an objective may always be attacked by an unutitilized creature from the opposing side.
Regardless of whether or not the assaulting creature loses, the creature attempting to score is distracted from scoring.

Card Types:

Slo Spells:  These are equipment, potions, rituals that must be performed or in actuality would take some time to perform.

Kwik Spells:  These are essentially spells that the wizard you hired is casting from your bench.  However there will be 
nothing so obvious as a fireball erupting from the dugout and encasing the opposing team creatures....FOUL!

20100701 Suggestion:  Foul Cards / Spell:  Part of the cost is that the player loses a point or opponent gains a point.
Or cannot score in the same turn as a foul card is played.

Creatures:  These are the creatures doing battle in the coliseum.
*

Play Cards:  Creatures may enter the Coliseum, be played as support (mana), or spells can be cast, kwik or slo.
