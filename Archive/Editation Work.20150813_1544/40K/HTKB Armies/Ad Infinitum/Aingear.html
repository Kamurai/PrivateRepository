Scanners: This hardware is a short range scanner to detect hidden troops.  If enemy infiltrators set up within 4D6" of a model with a Scanners, then the model is allowed a free shot or sound the alarm (Raid Scenario).
  If the model is part of a unit, then the whole unit may shoot before the game begins, normal shooting rules apply and this can cause Infiltrators to fall back. 
<br><br>
Alternate Power Source:  If a model with Alternate Power Source is killed, place the model on its side, and roll a D6 at the start of the next turn.  On a D6 roll of 6 the model is stood back up with 1 wound, and on any other roll is taken as a causality.
<br><br>
Chainfist:  This gives a Powerfist a 2D6 roll for armor penetration.
<br><br>
Fusion Jets:  Fusion Jets allow a 12" move per turn, and ignore difficult terrain.  A character can only use 
Fusion Jets if the rest of the units in a squad are also equipped with Fusion Jets.  Characters with Fusion Jets may use Deep Strike rules.
<br><br>
Power Claws:  Count as a Power Weapon, and may re-roll failed wounds.  Models armed with a Power Claw only get a +1 Attack modifier for an additional Close Combat Weapon if the 2nd weapon is another Power Claw.
<br><br>
Master-Crafted Weapons:  A Master-Crafted Weapon may re-roll a missed hit (you cannot Master Craft Grenades).  If you Master Craft a weapon it's 15 points extra, but does not count towards the 100 point limit on Wargear.
<br><br>
Teleport Homer:  This will allows a unit Deep Striking to not scatter upon teleportation, but only works with teleportation, not those that are dropped.
