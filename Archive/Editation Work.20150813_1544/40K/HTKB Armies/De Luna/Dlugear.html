Alternate Power Source:  If a model with Alternate Power Source is killed, place the model on its side, and roll a D6 at the start of the next turn.  On a D6 roll of 6 the model is stood back up with 1 wound, and on any other roll is taken as a causality.
<br><br>
Fusion Rockets:  Fusion Rockets allow a 12" move per turn, and ignore difficult terrain.  A character can only use Fusion Rockets if the rest of the units in a squad are also equipped with 
Fusion Rockets.  Characters with Fusion Rockets may use Deep Strike rules.

Scanners: This hardware is a short range scanner to detect hidden troops.  If enemy infiltrators set up within 4D6" of a model with a Scanners, then the model is allowed a free shot or sound the alarm (Raid Scenario).
  If the model is part of a unit, then the whole unit may shoot before the game begins, normal shooting rules apply and this can cause Infiltrators to fall back.

Searchlight:  Only used for games with Night Fighting rules.  it allows an enemy unit spotted by the vehicle to be shot at by the rest of your army.  A vehicle with a searchlight is suseptable to enemy fire.
<br><br>
Smoke Launchers:  These are used once per battle.  They can be used any turn, regardless of movement, but cannot shoot during the same turn they are used.  Any Penetrating hits are counted as Glancing hits when concealed, this only lasts one turn.
<br><br>
Teleport Homer:  This will allows a unit Deep Striking to not scatter upon teleportation, but only works with teleportation, not those that are dropped.
