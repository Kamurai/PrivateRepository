Rejuvenation:  If a model with Rejuvenation is killed, place the model on its side, and roll a D6 at the start of the next turn.  On a D6 roll of 6 the model is stood back up with 1 wound, and on any other roll is taken as a causuality.
<br><br>
Acid Sacs:  These give a model a 2D6 roll for armour penetration in addition to its Strength.

Pituitary Glands: Pituitary Glands allow a 12" move per turn, and ignore difficult terrain.  A character can only use a Jump Pack if the rest of the units in a squad are also equipped with Pituitary Glands.  Characters with Wings may use Deep Strike rules.

Adrenlines:  Adrenline Sacs allow a model to re-roll a missed hit (in Close Combat).
<br><br>
